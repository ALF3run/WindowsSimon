# WindowsSimon
My interpretation of the Simon game. I merged the game with the Windows 7 logo and this is the result: https://alf3run.github.io/WindowsSimon/.

The project was inspired by the FreeCodeCamp challenge <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-simon-game">Build a Simon Game</a>.
